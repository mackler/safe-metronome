Safe Metronome
==============

by Adam Mackler
---------------

Are you looking for a simple metronome app that does **not** access
the Internet, read your phone contacts, or know your GPS coordinates?
Consider **Safe Metronome**, by Adam Mackler:

- Uses no special permissions
- Is free with no ads
- Works in portrait or landscape rotation
- Supports languages: Español, Français, Italiano, Polski, Português, Svenska,
  беларуская, ру́сский
- Comes with two natural sounds (clave or cowbell)

_But wait...there's more!_  **Safe Metronome** is the only metronome with ChopsBuilder™.

ChopsBuilder™ is based on the scientific principle of "progressive
overload."  While you practice, ChopsBuilder™ gradually increases its
speed until you reach your desired tempo. This secret trick has been
used for generations by virtuoso musicians to develop their ability to
[shred](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shred) the most
difficult passages and make it look easy. ChopsBuilder™ is brought to
you now for the first time ever in an Android app, exclusively in
**Safe Metronome**.

Compare **Safe Metronome** to all the other free metronome apps for
Android.  If you can find a better one, let us know.
