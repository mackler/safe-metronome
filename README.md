Safe Metronome
==============

---------------

If you cannot think of a good reason why a simple metronome app needs
to access the Internet, read your phone number, or know your GPS
coordinates, then this may be the metronome for you.

- No special permissions
- No ads
- No upgrades
- No distracting graphics
- Actually keeps accurate time
- Choice of two sounds (clave or cowbell)

Compare this app to all the other free metronome apps for Android.  If
you can find a better one, let me know.
