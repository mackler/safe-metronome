Are you looking for a simple metronome app that does **not** access
the Internet, read your phone contacts, or know your GPS coordinates?
**Safe Metronome**, by Adam Mackler, has:

- No special permissions
- No ads
- No nagging for upgrades
- No distracting graphics
- Works in portrait or landscape orientation
- Actually keeps accurate time
- Choice of two natural sounds (clave or cowbell)

_But wait...there's more!_  **Safe Metronome** is the only metronome with ChopsBuilder™.

ChopsBuilder™ is based on the scientific principle of "progressive
overload."  While you practice, ChopsBuilder™ gradually increases its
speed until you reach your desired tempo. This secret trick has been
used for generations by virtuoso musicians to develop their ability to
[shred](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shred) the most
difficult passages and make it look easy. ChopsBuilder™ is brought to
you now for the first time in an Android app, exclusively in **Safe
Metronome**.

Accept no substitutes. Demand the genuine **Safe Metronome** with
ChopsBuilder™.

Compare **Safe Metronome** to all the other free metronome apps for
Android.  If you can find a better one, let us know.
